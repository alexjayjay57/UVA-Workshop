# UVA-Workshop
 
 *This is the repo that has the SwiftUI exercises and examples from the UVA Workshop!*

 **Few Prerequisites:**
 - Make sure you have a Mac to run Xcode on. If you don't have a Mac, any computer that can run VScode will work, just make sure to download the Swift extension. 
     - Only XCode users will be able to use the iOS Simulator as they work 

**What's Included?**
- The *ToDoList* folder has an example To Do list that you can use for inspiration on things to add/how we get to a final project. 
- The *Examples* folder has all of the examples that we did before the exercises. Feel free to reference those when creating your app
